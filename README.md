# world_cup_2018_prediction
The aim of the project is to collect and prepare data about FIFA-2018 football world cup approved players with a huge selection of attributes like basic player information, performance features, and playing position data. The objectives achieved are as follows: (1) Calculate the match outcomes according to team ratings through data exploration. (2) Check credibility of team ratings based on player performance attributes through prediction. 

Dataset Description: The ‘FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset’ contains statistics of around ~ 18K players and 70+ player attributes. The Dataset includes columns such as:
(1) Player personal attributes (Nationality, Club, Photo, Age, Value etc.)
(2) Player performance attributes (Overall, Potential, Aggression, Agility etc.)
(3) Player preferred position and ratings at all positions.
The data is scraped from the website https://sofifa.com by extracting the player statistics using a scraping program developed in python. This dataset is also available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset
